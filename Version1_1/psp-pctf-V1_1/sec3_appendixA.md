|            Term             | Definition |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| anonymous credential        | A credential that, while still making an assertion about some property, status, or right of a person, does not reveal the person's identity. A credential may contain identity attributes but still be treated as an anonymous credential if the identity attributes are not recognized or used for identity information validation purposes. Anonymous credentials provide persons with a means to prove statements about themselves and their relationships with other persons or organizations while maintaining their anonymity.|
| assigned identifier         | A numeric or alphanumeric string that is generated automatically and that uniquely distinguishes between persons or organizations without the use of any other identity attributes.|
| assurance                   | Confidence that a statement is true.|
| assurance level             | A level of confidence that a statement is true that may be relied on by others.|
| atomic process              | A set of logically related activities that results in the state transition of an object. The object’s output state can be relied on by other atomic processes.|
| attribute                   | A property or characteristic associated with an entity. See also “identity attribute”.|
| authentication              | See “credential verification”.|
| authenticator               | Something that a Holder controls (e.g., a cryptographic module or a password) that is used to prove that the Holder has retained control over an issued credential.|
| authoritative source        | A collection or registry of records maintained by an authority that meets established criteria.|
| biological or behavioural characteristic confirmation    | An identity verification method that uses biological (anatomical and physiological) characteristics (e.g., face, fingerprints, retinas) or behavioural characteristics (e.g., keyboard stroke timing, gait) to prove that the person presenting the identity information is in control of the identity. Biological or behavioural characteristic confirmation is achieved by means of the challenge- response model: the biological or behavioural characteristics recorded on a document or in a data store are compared to the person presenting the identity information.|
| biometrics                  | A general term used alternatively to describe a characteristic or a process. It can refer to a measurable biological (anatomical and physiological) or behavioural characteristic that can be used for automated recognition.

Once the consent information has been stored, a notification on the consent decision made is issued to the relevant parties to the consent decision.|
| consent renewal             | The process of extending the validity of a “yes” consent decision by means of increasing an expiration date limit.|
