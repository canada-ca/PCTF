## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document describes **Version 1.1** of the public sector profile of the **_Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)_**. The document is structured as follows:

* **Section 1** describes the purpose and audience of the document;
* **Section 2** describes the main elements of the PCTF; and
* **Sections 3 through 9** provide various appendices that cover terms and definitions, discussions on selected topics related to the PCTF, a list of issues that will be resolved in future versions of the document, and a bibliography.

The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework will facilitate the transition to a digital ecosystem for citizens and residents of Canada. A Canadian digital ecosystem will increase efficiency and secure interoperability between existing business processes, such as open banking, business licencing, and public sector service delivery.

The PCTF is simple and integrative; technology-agnostic; complementary to existing frameworks; clearly linked to policy, regulation, and legislation; and is designed to apply relevant standards to key processes and capabilities.

The PCTF facilitates a common approach between all levels of government and the private sector thereby serving the needs of the various communities who need to trust digital identities. The PCTF is defined in a way that encourages innovation and the evolution of the digital ecosystem. The PCTF allows for the interoperability of different platforms, services, architectures, and technologies.

The PCTF defines two types of *digital representations* that are essential for the development of the digital ecosystem:

1. *Digital identities* of entities such as persons, organizations, and devices; and
2. *Digital relationships* between entities.

The PCTF supports the acceptance of digital identities and digital relationships by defining a set of discrete process patterns, known as *atomic processes*. These atomic processes can be mapped to existing business processes, independently assessed using conformance criteria<sup id="fnr-conformanceCriteria1"><a href="#fn-conformanceCriteria1" class="fnote"></a></sup>, and certified to be trusted and interoperable within the digital ecosystem.
