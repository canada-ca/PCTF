This appendix provides some additional background information on the nature of persons and organizations from a strictly legal perspective.

### 5.1 Legal Entities

In law there are of two kinds of legal entities: human beings which are known as *natural persons* (also called *physical persons*), and non-human *juridical persons* – also called *juridic persons*, *juristic persons*, *artificial persons*, *legal persons*, or *fictitious persons* (Latin: *persona ficta*) – such as a corporation, a firm, a business or non-business group, or a government agency, etc., that are treated in law as if they were natural persons. Note, however, that the use of the term *legal person* to represent only a non- human legal entity is incorrect. In law, both human and non-human legal entities are recognized as legal persons that have certain privileges and obligations such as the legal capacity to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.

Human beings acquire *legal personhood* when they are born (or even before [i.e., a foetus] insomejurisdictions). Juridical persons acquire legalpersonhoodwhen they are incorporated in accordance with law. The term *legal personality* is used to describe the characteristic of having acquired the status of legal personhood.

Legal personhood is a prerequisite to *legal capacity* i.e., the ability of any legal person to transact (enter into, amend, transfer, etc.) rights andobligations. For example, in international law legal personality is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name.

### 5.2 Juridical Persons

A juridical person has a legal name and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and liabilities in law, similar to those of a natural person. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental *legal fiction*. It is pertinent to the philosophy of law, as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation (i.e., corporate law).

Juridical personality is the characteristic of a non-living legal entity regarded by law to have the status of legal personhood.

Juridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (*universitas personarum*) to act as a single entity (a body corporate) for legal purposes. In many jurisdictions, juridical personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its shareholders). A juridical person may sue and be sued, enter contracts, incur debt, and own property. A juridical person may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with juridical personality may shield its members from personal liability.

In some common law jurisdictions a distinction is drawn between a *corporation aggregate* (such as a company, which is composed of a number of members) and a *corporation sole*, which is a public office of legal personality separated from the individual holding the office. Historically, most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury is a corporation sole), but a number of other public offices are now formed as corporations sole.

The concept of juridical personality is not absolute. "Piercing the corporate veil" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as *agents* involved in a company action or decision. This may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or public limited company are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or directors.

### 5.3 History of Juridical Persons

The concept of legal personhood for organizations of people (juridical personhood) is at least as old as Ancient Rome: a variety of collegial institutions enjoyed the benefit under Roman law.

The doctrine of juridical personhood has been attributed to Pope Innocent IV who helped to spread the idea of persona ficta. In canon law, the doctrine of persona ficta allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks themselves took vows of personal poverty. Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of delict<sup id="fnr-Delict"><a href="#fn-Delict" class="fnote"></a></sup> due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities. This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence.

In the common law tradition, only a natural person could sue or be sued. This was not a problem in the era before the Industrial Revolution, when the typical business venture was either a sole proprietorship or partnership – the owners were simply liable for the debts of the business. A feature of the corporation, however, is that the owners/shareholders enjoyed limited liability – the owners were not liable for the debts of the company. Thus, when a corporation breached a contract or broke a law, there was no remedy, because limited liability protected the owners and the corporation wasn't a legal person subject to the law. There was no accountability for corporate wrongdoing.

To resolve this issue, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights: the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees), and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).

Since the 19th century, legal personhood of an organization has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state. The concept of a juridical person is now central to Western law in both common-law and civil-law countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.

### 5.4 Examples of Juridical Persons

Some examples of juridical persons include:

* Corporation: A body corporate created by statute or charter. A corporation aggregate is a corporation constituted by two or more natural persons. A corporation sole is a corporation constituted by a single natural person, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, in order to give them some legal benefit or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person cannot have. Examples of corporations sole are a religious officiant in that capacity, or The Crown in the Commonwealth realms. Municipal corporations (municipalities) are "creatures of statute". Other organizations may be created by statute as legal persons including European economic interest groupings (EEIGs).
* Partnership: An aggregate of two or more natural persons to carry on a business in common for profit and created by agreement. Traditionally, partnerships did not have continuing legal personality, but many jurisdictions now treat them as having such.
* Company: A form of business association that carries on an industrial enterprise. A company is often a corporation, although a company may take other forms, such as a trade union, an unlimited company, a trust, or a fund. A limited liability company – whether it is a private company limited by guarantee, a private company limited by shares, ora public limited company – is a business association having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Different types of companies have a complex variety of advantages and disadvantages.
* Cooperative(co-op): A business organization owned and democratically operated by a group of natural persons for their mutual benefit.
* Unincorporated association: An aggregate of two or more natural persons which are treated as juridical persons in some jurisdictions but not others.
* Sovereign states are juridical persons.
* In the international legal system, various organizations possess legal personality. These include intergovernmental organizations (e.g., the United Nations, theCouncil of Europe) and some otherinternational organizations(including the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a religious order).
* The European Union (EU) has had legal personality since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force on December 1, 2009. That the EU has legal personality is a prerequisite for the EU to join the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, in 2014, the EU decided not to be bound by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.
* Temples, in some legal systems, have separate legal personality.

Not all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body of which they are a part.

### 5.5 Legal Entity Information

In Canada, the treatment and handling of personal information (information about an identifiable person) and organizational information (information about an identifiable organization) differs significantly. This is shown in the following table:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Legislative and Regulatory Provisions</th>
            <th colspan="2">Scope and Application</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Personal Information</b></td>
            <td><b>Organizational Information</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Privacy</td>
            <td>All</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protection</td>
            <td>All</td>
            <td>Some</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

From this table it can be seen that whereas all personal information is subject to privacy and protection guarantees, organizational information is not considered private but some organizational information may be protected by confidentiality agreements.
